<x-layout :title="'NO VUE HERE (DEFAULT)'">

<p>This page has absolutely nothing. It's meant to be an example of a default
page build with the help of the <strong>&lt;x-layout&gt; component</strong>. Notice that since
this text is not inside any container, it reaches the edges of the screen. I
mean I couldn't be more happier to see my text with no containers as it can get
really long. Anyway, I get your point. Let's try to use a container.</p>

    <div class="container">
        Oh look I am inside a container and therefore I am restricted and totally
        in the middle of the screen somewhere. I enjoy it here. Middle is nice.
        What is so nice about these containers is that they have sensible margins
        and paddings and other nice things that everyone enjoys these days.
        Did you notice that the footer moves with me? If you make the window
        really small, then footer goes to the right side of the window! How
        cool is that!
    </div>
